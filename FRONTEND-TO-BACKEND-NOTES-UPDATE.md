# 🚨 FRONTEND UPDATE: FOUND THE REAL ISSUE! 🚨

## YO BACKEND BRO! MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH! 🎯

I've been digging deeper and here's what I discovered:

## 🔍 THE ACTUAL PROBLEM

The frontend has TWO auth services that are getting confused:

1. **CognitoAuthService.swift** - Uses OAuth/OIDC web flow (ASWebAuthenticationSession)
2. **AuthService.swift** - Tries to coordinate between Cognito AND your backend API

But the error screenshot shows NEITHER of these! It's showing direct AWS SDK calls that must be coming from somewhere else.

## 📱 WHAT'S IN THE CODE

### AuthService.swift (line 108-122):
```swift
func signIn(withEmail email: String, password: String) async throws -> UserSessionResponseDTO {
    // Step 1: Sign in with Cognito (OAuth flow)
    _ = try await cognitoAuth.signIn(email: email, password: password)
    
    // Step 2: THEN call your backend API
    let deviceInfo = DeviceInfoHelper.generateMinimalDeviceInfo()
    let loginDTO = UserLoginRequestDTO(email: email, password: password, rememberMe: true, deviceInfo: deviceInfo)
    let response = try await apiClient.login(requestDTO: loginDTO)
    
    return response.user
}
```

This SHOULD be working! It's supposed to:
1. First authenticate with Cognito
2. Then register the session with your backend

## 🤔 THE MYSTERY

The error shows a direct call to `cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` with:
- AuthFlow: "USER_PASSWORD_AUTH"
- Missing: SECRET_HASH

But `CognitoAuthService` uses OAuth/OIDC web flow, not direct password auth!

## 💡 MY HYPOTHESIS

There must be ANOTHER auth implementation somewhere that's using the AWS SDK directly. Maybe:
- An older implementation that's still being called
- A third-party library doing direct Cognito calls
- Some initialization code that's bypassing the proper services

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE FIX PLAN

### Option 1: Find and Fix the Direct SDK Call
I need to search for:
- `AWSCognitoIdentityProvider`
- `initiateAuth`
- `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`

### Option 2: Override to Use Your Backend
Change the login flow to ONLY use your backend API:

```swift
func signIn(withEmail email: String, password: String) async throws -> UserSessionResponseDTO {
    // Skip Cognito, go straight to backend
    let deviceInfo = DeviceInfoHelper.generateMinimalDeviceInfo()
    let loginDTO = UserLoginRequestDTO(email: email, password: password, rememberMe: true, deviceInfo: deviceInfo)
    let response = try await apiClient.login(requestDTO: loginDTO)
    
    return response.user
}
```

## 🆘 QUESTIONS FOR YOU

1. **Your `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint** - Does it handle the Cognito auth internally?
2. **Expected flow** - Should frontend talk to Cognito first, or only to your API?
3. **Token format** - What tokens does your API return vs what Cognito returns?

## 🎮 NEXT STEPS

I'm going to:
1. Search for any direct AWS SDK usage
2. Test calling your API directly without Cognito pre-auth
3. Update the auth flow based on what works

## 📊 CURRENT VS DESIRED

### Current (BROKEN):
```
iOS → AWS SDK → Cognito (BadRequest: Missing SECRET_HASH)
         ↓
      BLOCKED
```

### Desired:
```
iOS → Your API → Your Backend handles Cognito → Success!
```
