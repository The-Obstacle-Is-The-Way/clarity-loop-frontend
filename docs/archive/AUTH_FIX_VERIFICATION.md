# Authentication Fix Verification Guide

## Problem Found
The iOS app was creating APIClients with `tokenProvider: { nil }` in default environment values, causing requests to be sent without Authorization headers.

## Fix Applied
Updated `EnvironmentKeys.swift` to use a shared `defaultTokenProvider` that:
1. Attempts to get the current Firebase user's ID token
2. Provides proper authentication even for default/fallback environment values
3. Logs warnings when no user is available

## Changes Made
```swift
// Before (BROKEN):
tokenProvider: { nil }

// After (FIXED):
tokenProvider: defaultTokenProvider
```

## How to Test

### 1. Clean Build
```bash
# In Xcode or terminal
xcodebuild clean -scheme clarity-loop-frontend
```

### 2. Run the App
1. Launch the app on simulator/device
2. Sign in with valid credentials
3. Navigate to the Debug tab

### 3. Test Authentication
In the Debug tab:
1. Tap "Test Generate Insight (Auth Required)"
2. Should see 200 OK response (not 401)
3. Check console logs for:
   - "✅ Default environment: Token retrieved for user..."
   - "✅ APP: Token obtained in provider"

### 4. Test Chat Feature
1. Navigate to AI Chat tab
2. Send a message
3. Should receive AI response (not error)

### 5. Monitor Logs
Look for these success indicators:
```
🚀 APIClient: Starting request to /api/v1/insights/generate
🔑 APIClient: Attempting to retrieve auth token...
✅ APIClient: Token retrieved (length: XXX)
📤 APIClient: Authorization header set: Bearer eyJ...
📥 APIClient: Response status code: 200
✅ APIClient: Successfully decoded response
```

## Expected Results
- All authenticated endpoints should return 200 OK
- No more "No user context in request.state" errors
- Chat and insights features work properly

## If Still Failing
1. Check if Firebase is properly initialized
2. Verify user is actually logged in
3. Use TokenDebugView to inspect token claims
4. Check backend logs for middleware hits

## Backend Verification
The backend should now show:
```
🔥 MIDDLEWARE HIT: POST /api/v1/insights/generate
✅ Valid Firebase token for user: XXX
```

Instead of:
```
🔥 MIDDLEWARE HIT: POST /api/v1/insights/generate  
❌ No Authorization header found in request
```
