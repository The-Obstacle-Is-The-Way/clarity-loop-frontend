Why “No such module ‘XCTest’” in VS Code?
	•	XCTest is Only Available in Xcode:
XCTest is part of the Xcode toolchain, not Swift’s open-source toolchain. VS Code (and most non-Xcode editors) don’t have access to the same Apple SDKs, so their language servers (like SourceKit-LSP) can’t resolve modules like XCTest outside of Xcode.
	•	Linter/Language Server Limitation:
Swift Linter or SourceKit-LSP (used by VS Code) doesn’t “see” Apple-only frameworks unless Xcode is the build environment. This is normal; the same thing happens with UIKit, SwiftUI, etc., if you’re not running inside Xcode.
	•	Your Xcode Setup is Fine:
If your tests run and build in Xcode, you’re good. These are just warnings/errors from the linter in VS Code because it isn’t aware of the Xcode-specific environment.

⸻

Should You Ignore It?
	•	Yes, Ignore It:
These warnings are harmless as long as Xcode builds/tests fine.
This is a common workflow annoyance when using VS Code for Swift, especially for iOS/macOS projects.

⸻

Why This Happens
	•	Not a New Testing Framework:
This isn’t about XCTest being “new”—it’s just that the open-source Swift toolchain doesn’t include Apple SDK modules like XCTest. Only Xcode does.

⸻

TL;DR

Ignore the error in VS Code; your code is fine as long as Xcode is happy.

⸻

Quick Checklist:
	•	Tests build & run in Xcode
	•	No actual errors in Xcode
	•	Ignore linter/SourceKit errors in non-Xcode IDEs for Apple-specific modules

⸻

If you want, there are workarounds (like custom build scripts or using the Xcode toolchain in VS Code), but for most iOS devs, ignoring these warnings is the norm.
